  Note: If you signed up for this site before February 2013, you will need to
  = link_to "reset your password", new_user_password_path
  before logging in. I recently updated the authentication system with beefier encryption keys, and the old ones no longer work. You will only have to do this once and you may use the same password as before without an issue.

    Sorry for the inconvenience!
